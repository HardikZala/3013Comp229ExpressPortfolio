      <h2>Bank Marketing Data</h2>    
      <p>
        * Created a Regression Model to identify customers that are likely to convert Methods used:
        * Performing Exploratory Data Analysis to identify null values, data redundancies, outliers
          * Identify use cases for predictive models
        * Preprocessing of features to align with Logistic Regression guidelines
        * normalization of continuous features, through log transformation
        * feature standardization
        * creating binary features
        * creating one-hot encoded features
        * Creating a Logistic Regression to achieve an 89.4% accuracy
        * Visualizing results using a confusion matrix
        Findings:
        * highest predictors of customers likely to convert were:
        * Having previously been contacted
        * Retained/returning customers
        * Retired individuals

      <h2>Seattle House Prices Prediction</h2>
      <p>
        * Predict Housing prices using a linear regression model, polynomial regression model
        * Evaluate the model parameters using Ridge regression Methods used:
        * Data Cleaning: Remove, and replace missing and null values
        * Exploratory Data Analysis: identifying outliers and correlations between data
        * Developing the model based on selected features 
        * number of floors, waterfront location, latitude, bedrooms etc. 
        * was accurately able to predict house prices with a 64.7% accuracy

      <h2>Securities Portfolio Risk Calculator</h2>
      <p>
        * Streamlined access to key financial metrics for financial investors for portfolio optimization through presented metrics for portfolio beta, Capital Asset Pricing Model, Jensenâ€™s Alpha, Portfolio Standard Deviation etc.
        * Ensured consistent data through real-time trading data by web scraping (Beautiful Soup) and APIs calls (Yahoo Finance)
        * Allow for user input securities to create a portfolio with stocks, and weights
