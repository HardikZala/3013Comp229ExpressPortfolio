          * Identify use cases for predictive models<br>
        * Preprocessing of features to align with Logistic Regression guidelines<br>
        * normalization of continuous features, through log transformation<br>
        * feature standardization<br>
        * creating binary features<br>
        * creating one-hot encoded features<br>
        * Creating a Logistic Regression to achieve an 89.4% accuracy<br>
        * Visualizing results using a confusion matrix<br>
        Findings:<br>

      <h2>Seattle House Prices Prediction</h2>
      <p>
        * Predict Housing prices using a linear regression model, polynomial regression model<br>
        * Evaluate the model parameters using Ridge regression Methods used:<br>
        * Data Cleaning: Remove, and replace missing and null values<br>
        * Exploratory Data Analysis: identifying outliers and correlations between data<br>
        * Developing the model based on selected features <br>
        * number of floors, waterfront location, latitude, bedrooms etc. <br>
        * was accurately able to predict house prices with a 64.7% accuracy<br>
